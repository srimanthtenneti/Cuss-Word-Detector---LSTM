# Cuss-Word-Detection using LSTMs

## Project 
This code implements a cuss word detector using some samples and an LSTM array. A total of 7 cuss words are going to be taken in various contexts and the detector is going to be implemented.

These words are rated in between medium - strong by the BBC.
